This project is based on K-Means Clustering and Natural Language porcessing. 
In this project, anthem dataset is used from kaggle and text preprocessing is done on the anthems. 
Text preprocessing ( Stopword Removal, Pronounciation symbol removal, Lemmetization and Stemming ) is performed in the anthem column.
Word2vec and tf-idf are used for forming word embeddings and Vectorize the words on the basis of their importance and occurence frequency. 
Later, K-Means CLustering is used to form 5 clusters to group the anthems and their following countries.  
These clusters could be visualised by using online tool iipmaps.com . 
The clusters formed represent the similar sentiments in the anthems of all countries. 
This project show how can we group countries into clusters on basis of anthems using NLP and K-Means Clustering.
I developed this machine learning project by following a YouTube tutorial, putting in effort to understand and experiment the process to improve my skills.
